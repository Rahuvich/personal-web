            <br />
            <br />I am a self-driven person who enjoys learning and creating all
            kinds of projects. Not only I relish working as a team as it
            requires communication and dedication, but also I have an open mind
            to new ideas and appreciate learning from others with more knowledge
            and experience. In addition, I am a positive person who enjoys
            maintaining the enthusiasm in a work environment. <br />
            <br />
            My expertise is composed of different types of projects, although I
            enjoy the most developing beautiful cross platform mobile apps based
            on the user experience, using{" "}
            <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. I also have developed
            some cross platform games with the help of{" "}
