# Personal web for my portfolio

I decided to develop my portfolio website. There I show you some personal projects from the Github API v4 GraphQL.

### Tools used

I needed to implement a React application for one of my personal projects, so I decided to use React to develop my personal website for training purposes.

- React JS - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- GraphQL - to comunicate with Github API, more efficient than a REST API.
- Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
